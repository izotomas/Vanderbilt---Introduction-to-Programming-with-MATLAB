%{
An n-by-n square logical matrix can be represented by a cell vector of n elements where
the kth element corresponds to the kth row of the matrix. Each element of the cell vector is
a row vector of positive integers in increasing order representing the column indexes of the
logical true values in the given row of the matrix. All other elements in the given row of
the logical matrix are false. Write a function called logiunpack that takes such a cell vector
as its only input and returns the corresponding square logical matrix. For example, such a cell
vector representation of a 100-by-100 logical matrix with the only true elements at indexes (10,20)
and (10,75) would have only one non-empty element of the cell vector at index 10.
That element is the vector [20 75].

function M = logiunpack(cell)
[~, c] = size(cell);
M = false(c);
for i = 1:length(cell(:))
    M(i,cell{i}) = true;
end
